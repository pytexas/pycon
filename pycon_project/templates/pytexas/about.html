        <h2>About This Site</h2>

        <p>This site acts as the primary public facing website to the PyTexas Conference. It is built using Google Blogger. Brad Allen maintains the site, but other community members are given access to post to the blog upon request.</p>

        <h3>About the Registration and Survey Forms</h3>

        <p>The forms on this site are built using Google Docs, which means any data you fill out will be stored on Google servers. We're using Google Doc forms as a "good enough" tool to reduce effort on the part of PyTexas organizers.</p>

        <p>A note about email addresses: your email address will be kept private, only accessible to a limited number of PyTexas organizers at the discretion of the chairman (Brad Allen). Your email address will be utilized as a unique key across surveys; please try to be consistent and use only a single email address on all the surveys, or when updating the survey. If you make a mistake on this, please contact Brad Allen.</p>

        <h3>Contact Us</h3>

        <p>Please feel free to email Brad Allen using his gmail account (bradallen137). He uses the same account name for Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, and other public facing websites.</p>
